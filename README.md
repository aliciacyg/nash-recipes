# 🍽️ Nash Recipes

**The Nash Online Food Sheet** is meant to be a simple, personal website that holds all the recipes my family and I usually make in our kitchen, as well as some recipes we've come up with that we want to keep for generations to come. It also will include a grocery list feature.

## 🧾 Purpose

This project is designed to function like a family cookbook that’s:

- 📱 Easy to access on mobile devices (for quick use in the kitchen)
- 💻 Desktop-friendly for browsing and updates
- ♻️ Environmentally conscious by reducing paper usage

## ✅ Features (WIP)

- Organized recipe collection
- Responsive layout (navbar and collapsible content)
- Grocery list tool to manage ingredients more sustainably
- Clean and minimal design for fast access and usability

## 🚀 Future Plans

As a stretch goal, I’d like to implement:

- A **“Add to Grocery List”** button for each recipe  
  ➤ This will automatically add the ingredients (excluding pantry staples) to the grocery list
